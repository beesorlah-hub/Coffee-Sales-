## âœ…Conclusion
The analysis reveals that BeeBean Co.'s revenue is heavily concentrated in a few key products and regions, with Excelsa and Liberica accounting for the majority of sales and the United States alone generating nearly 80% of total revenue. This indicates a high dependency on limited product lines and geographic markets.

To drive sustainable growth, BeeBean Co. should consider:

1. Expanding marketing efforts for underperforming products like Arabica and Robusta.

2. Exploring new international markets to diversify geographic revenue sources.

3. Leveraging top customer segments through loyalty programs or targeted upselling strategies.

4. These insights will help the company reduce risk, unlock new revenue streams, and enhance customer lifetime value.
